# LSB-Image-Steganography
This project implements LSB Image Steganography, a technique used to hide secret information inside a bitmap (BMP) image by modifying the least significant bits of the image’s pixel data. The goal of this project is to securely embed a secret file into an image without altering the visible appearance of the image. The secret file may be a text file, a C program file, or a shell script, and the system ensures that the original extension is preserved during encoding and restored accurately during decoding.
During the encoding process, the program reads the input BMP image and the secret file. It then inserts a unique magic string (“#*”) into the image to mark the beginning of hidden data. After that, it embeds the file extension, file size, and file contents into the least significant bits of the image pixels. The resulting output is a stego image, which looks identical to the original image but securely contains the hidden file.
In the decoding process, the program reads the stego image and extracts the embedded data by reversing the same bit-level operations. It first reads the magic string to confirm that valid secret data exists. Then, it retrieves the file extension and reconstructs the correct output filename, even if the user provides a wrong or different extension. Finally, the file contents are extracted and written into a new file, perfectly restoring the original secret data.
This project demonstrates the practical application of information hiding, digital security, bitwise operations, and file handling in C programming. It can be used for secure data transmission, watermarking, and digital communication systems where confidentiality and data integrity are required.
